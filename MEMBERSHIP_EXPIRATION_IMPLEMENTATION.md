# Membership Expiration System Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds automatic expiration handling for user memberships, ensuring that:

1. **Memberships become inactive** after their duration elapses
2. **Subscription packages become available** when users have no active memberships
3. **QR Codes menu is hidden** when users have 0 active memberships
4. **UI updates immediately** after expiration without requiring page refresh

## Files Modified

### Database Migrations
- `database/SIMPLE_MEMBERSHIP_EXPIRATION_FIX.sql` - Main migration
- `database/ROLLBACK_MEMBERSHIP_EXPIRATION.sql` - Rollback migration

### Frontend Changes
- `src/utils/membershipApi.ts` - Updated queries to check both `status` and `end_date`
- `src/components/layout/Layout.tsx` - Updated membership checks
- `src/utils/activeMemberships.ts` - Updated active membership queries
- `src/utils/qrSystem.ts` - Updated QR code permission checks
- `src/pages/QRCodes.tsx` - Added no active membership message
- `src/components/NoActiveMembershipMessage.tsx` - New component for empty state

### New Utilities
- `src/utils/membershipExpiration.ts` - Helper functions for expiration management
- `test-membership-expiration.js` - Test script for verification

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema Changes

1. **Added `is_active` column** to `memberships` table
2. **Added `expires_at` column** for future timestamp-based queries
3. **Updated existing functions** to handle both `status` and `is_active` fields

### Query Logic Updates

All membership queries now check:
```sql
WHERE status = 'active' 
AND is_active = true 
AND end_date >= CURRENT_DATE
```

This ensures that:
- Only truly active memberships are returned
- Expired memberships are automatically excluded
- The system is deterministic and consistent

### UI Behavior

1. **Membership Page**: Shows only active memberships, unlocks packages when none exist
2. **QR Codes Page**: Shows helpful message when no active memberships
3. **Navigation Menu**: Hides QR Codes when user has no active memberships
4. **Layout Component**: Updates membership status in real-time

## Installation Steps

### 1. Run Database Migration

Execute the migration in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Run this file
database/SIMPLE_MEMBERSHIP_EXPIRATION_FIX.sql
```

### 2. Set Up Background Job

Create a scheduled job to run the expiration function daily:

```sql
-- Example: Run daily at midnight
SELECT cron.schedule('expire-memberships', '0 0 * * *', 'SELECT expire_memberships();');
```

Or use Supabase Edge Functions with a cron trigger.

### 3. Test the Implementation

Run the test script:

```bash
node test-membership-expiration.js
```

### 4. Verify UI Behavior

1. **Create a test membership** with short duration
2. **Wait for expiration** or manually expire it
3. **Verify that**:
   - Membership no longer appears in active list
   - Package becomes available for purchase
   - QR Codes menu is hidden
   - QR Codes page shows helpful message

## Key Features

### Deterministic Expiration
- Uses database-level logic for consistency
- No race conditions or timing issues
- Works across multiple application instances

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing functionality preserved
- No breaking changes to existing APIs
- Gradual migration of data

### Real-time Updates
- UI reflects current membership status
- No need for manual refresh
- Immediate feedback to users

### Security
- Respects existing RLS policies
- No exposure of sensitive data
- Proper error handling

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Column does not exist" errors**
   - Ensure migration ran successfully
   - Check that `is_active` column was added

2. **Memberships not expiring**
   - Verify `expire_memberships()` function exists
   - Check that background job is running
   - Manually run: `SELECT expire_memberships();`

3. **UI not updating**
   - Clear browser cache
   - Check console for errors
   - Verify API calls are working

### Debug Commands

```sql
-- Check table structure
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'memberships';

-- Check function exists
SELECT proname FROM pg_proc WHERE proname = 'expire_memberships';

-- Check membership status
SELECT status, is_active, COUNT(*) FROM memberships GROUP BY status, is_active;

-- Manually expire memberships
SELECT expire_memberships();
```

## Rollback

If issues occur, run the rollback migration:

```sql
-- Run this file
database/ROLLBACK_MEMBERSHIP_EXPIRATION.sql
```

This will:
- Restore original functions
- Remove new helper functions
- Keep data intact (columns remain but can be removed if needed)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Migration runs without errors
- [ ] Functions are created successfully
- [ ] Existing memberships are preserved
- [ ] Expired memberships are hidden
- [ ] Packages unlock when no active memberships
- [ ] QR Codes menu hides when no active memberships
- [ ] Background job runs successfully
- [ ] UI updates in real-time
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing features

## Performance Considerations

- **Indexes**: Existing indexes on `end_date` and `user_id` are sufficient
- **Query Performance**: Additional `status` and `is_active` checks are minimal overhead
- **Background Jobs**: Run during low-traffic hours
- **Caching**: Consider caching active membership status for high-traffic scenarios

## Future Enhancements

1. **Email Notifications**: Notify users before expiration
2. **Grace Period**: Allow short grace period after expiration
3. **Auto-renewal**: Optional automatic renewal
4. **Analytics**: Track expiration patterns
5. **Bulk Operations**: Admin tools for bulk membership management
