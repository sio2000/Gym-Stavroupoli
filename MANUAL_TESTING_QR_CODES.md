# Manual Testing Guide - QR Code System Fix

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for manually testing the QR code system fix in a staging environment.

## Prerequisites
- Access to staging environment
- Admin credentials for Supabase dashboard
- Test users with various membership scenarios

## Pre-Testing Setup

### 1. Execute Database Migration
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor in staging environment
2. Copy and paste the contents of `database/FIX_EXPIRED_MEMBERSHIPS_FOR_QR_CODES.sql`
3. Run the verification query first:
   ```sql
   -- Check problematic memberships
   SELECT COUNT(*) as problematic_count 
   FROM memberships 
   WHERE is_active = true AND end_date < CURRENT_DATE;
   ```
4. If count > 0, execute the migration script
5. Uncomment `COMMIT;` to apply changes
6. Verify problematic count is now 0

### 2. Verify Database State
```sql
-- Check total memberships
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_memberships,
    SUM(CASE WHEN is_active = true THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as active_memberships,
    SUM(CASE WHEN is_active = false AND end_date < CURRENT_DATE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as expired_inactive_memberships,
    SUM(CASE WHEN is_active = true AND end_date < CURRENT_DATE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as problematic_memberships
FROM memberships;
```

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: User with No Memberships

**Objective**: Verify that users without any memberships see no QR code options.

**Steps**:
1. Find a user with no memberships in the database
2. Log in as that user
